# AI-Assisted-Code-Generation-Debugging
Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing an AI-powered system that suggests, optimizes, and debugs code based on user prompts. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models such as OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, or CodeLlama, the system provides real-time code assistance.

Features

Intelligent Code Suggestion: AI-powered recommendations based on user input.

Code Optimization: Refinement and efficiency improvements in generated code.

Debugging Support: Automated detection and resolution of common coding issues.

ComfyUI Integration: A no-code approach for prompt tuning and workflow customization.

Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface for seamless coding experience.

Technologies Used

LLMs: OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, CodeLlama

UI Framework: ComfyUI for no-code prompt tuning

Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript

Backend: Flask, FastAPI (optional)

Implementation Steps

LLM Integration: Connect OpenAI Codex, GPT-4, or CodeLlama for code generation.

UI Development: Design and implement an intuitive UI using ComfyUI.

Code Execution & Debugging: Enable real-time code execution and debugging.

Optimization Engine: Develop algorithms to refine AI-generated code.

Testing & Deployment: Validate system performance and deploy for end-users.
